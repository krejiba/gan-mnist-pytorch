# Generative Adversarial Networks | Pytorch  
In this project, I implemented a GAN in order to generate synthetic handwritten digits. I used images from the MNIST database for training.  
## How to use :
You need to download the notebook. Make sure to install NumPy and Pytorch in order to make use of this code. You need to have Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. You can use the notebook by typing `jupyter notebook gan-train.ipynb` in the command line. A new window will open in your browser.
You can run all code by clicking on "Cell" -> "Run All".  
For time saving purposes, I used Google Colab to run the code on a GPU device.
